# Hi

This is a template using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [Compiled](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/compiled) + [Twin.Macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro), with typescript support. The source is transpiled via [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) and then bundled together with [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

## Getting Started

Before anything, run:

```sh
npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.

To start development server:

```sh

```

To build the project:

```sh

```
